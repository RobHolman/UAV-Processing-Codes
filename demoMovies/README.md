The demoMovies are available at http://cil-www.oce.orst.edu/UAVdemoMovies.zip.  This zip file should be unpacked in the toolbox directory, creating a demoMovies directory.  There are two example movies, each in their own directory.  There is an empty demoOutput directory where the output files will go.  NOTE - if you have processed a demo movie once, the geometry solutions will be stored

The demoMovies are available at http://cil-www.oce.orst.edu/UAVdemoMovies.zip.  This zip file should be unpacked in the toolbox directory, creating a demoMovies directory.  There are two example movies, each in their own directory.  There is also an empty demoOutput directory where the output files will go.  NOTE - if you have processed a demo movie once, the geometry solutions will be stored in demoOutput by default.  If you then try the demo again, say for practice or because your student wants to try it, the routines will find that the geometry solutions already exist so won't bother to compute them anew, thereby making the demo not very useful for your student.  If you want to run the demo as a learning exercize, ensure that this directory is empty before you start.  (Actual data runs should each be stored in their own directory, so this is not an issue).
